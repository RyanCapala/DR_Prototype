Designated Ride is an Android app that provides transportation to users for non-emergency medical appointments. Users are able to request rides, manage their appointments, and book rides up to 24 hours in advance. The costs of transportation are covered by a userâ€™s health insurance, thus ensuring a free service to users.

Many patients who need to attend their medical appointments may be unable to transport themselves to the clinics/hospitals due to illness or lack of transportation. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that many public transportation services in the United States is often very limited or unreliable. There are other solutions currently deployed, such as competing ride sharing apps or taxi companies. However, these solutions often have relatively high costs, or their costs vary greatly based on location and demand.
